Convolutional Neural Networks Experiments

I created this repository for COM SCI 260C: Deep Learning at UCLA. I wanted to
experiment with different neural network architectures to see what performed
the best on CIFAR-10.

I also use this code to see how fast GPUs on various machines are by comparing
the training times.
